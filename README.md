# Ansible Collection - cdot65.prisma_access

## Overview

The goal of this collection is to provide an easier way to interact with
Palo Alto Networks's Prisma Access solution.

While nothing will stop you from using the built-in `uri` module against
Prisma's REST API, you may find that working with pre-packaged modules can
simplify the development of your playbook, or it may just be easier to support
as a team.

üìã Prisma Access version compatibility

Prisma Access is maintained by Palo Alto Networks, preventing you from
having to concern yourself with the underlying infrastructure. This prevents
you from worrying about version compatibility.

üìã Ansible version compatibility

Ansible is going through some rapid changes and while those changes get worked
out we will continue to test for Ansible 2.10.x.

It is unlikely that something will break on later Ansible versions,
but it is something to keep in mind.

‚öôÔ∏è Batteries Included

Here is a short list of modules included within the collection, expect feature
parity with the API spec before this project hits version 1.0.0

| Name                               | Description                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| cdot65.prisma_access.tag           | Manage Prisma Access tag objects           |
| cdot65.prisma_access.address       | Manage Prisma Access address objects       |
| cdot65.prisma_access.address_group | Manage Prisma Access address group objects |

üöÄ Executing the playbook
After installing the collections, you can call the modules by using their full name path.

tag.yaml

```yaml
---
# CONFIGURE TAG OBJECTS
- hosts: prisma
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  become: False
  collections:
    - cdot65.prisma_access

  tasks:
    - name: Create tags
      cdot65.prisma_access.tag:
        provider:
          client_id: "{{ client_id }}"
          client_secret: "{{ client_secret }}"
          scope: "{{ scope }}"
        name: "ansible"
        color: "Lavender"
        comments: "This is a test tag"
        folder: "Service Connections"
        state: "present"
```

Then simply run your playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook tag.yaml
```
